# Wastewater Treatment System with GEMs: A Sustainable Solution  

Our award-winning solution addresses the pressing issue of water pollution by introducing a cutting-edge wastewater treatment system. By leveraging advanced sensor technology, IoT, AI, and genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs), the system ensures efficient detection, neutralization, and management of harmful pollutants in real time, fostering sustainable water management practices.  

## Targeted Treatment Using GEMs  
At the core of our solution lies the innovative use of genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs), designed to target and neutralize specific pollutants. Treatment occurs in a batch-wise manner, with different GEM strains applied sequentially to degrade heavy metals, reduce nitrogen levels, and break down phosphates. These GEMs are immobilized within substrates like calcium alginate or porous gels, ensuring efficient pollutant breakdown while remaining stationary in the treatment chamber.  

## Real-Time Pollutant Detection and Purity Monitoring  
The system incorporates IoT-enabled sensors to monitor key water quality parameters such as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), turbidity, and pollutant concentrations. The collected data is processed in real time to detect contaminants and initiate treatment promptly. Post-treatment, a fluorescence-based detection system monitors water purity; the absence or minimal presence of fluorescence indicates that the water meets safety standards.  

This sustainable and versatile solution ensures treated water is safe for discharge into rivers, repurposing for domestic or industrial use, or returning to municipal systems, significantly contributing to ecological and environmental restoration.
